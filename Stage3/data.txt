'to the forecastle, whence, without a word or look of surprise, he gazed\n '
'a moment at the dog, knitted his brow, and, silent and unobserved as he\n '
'had come, retired to his kitchen.\n '
'\n '
'As the boat had rounded the stern of the drifting hull, it had been\n '
'observed that the one word "Waldeck" was painted on the aft-board, but\n '
'that there was no intimation of the port to which the ship belonged. To\n '
'Captain Hull's experienced eye, however, certain details of\n '
'construction gave a decided confirmation to the probability suggested\n '
'by her name that she was of American build.\n '
'\n '
'Of what had once been a fine brig of 500 tons burden this hopeless\n '
'wreck was now all that remained. The large hole near the bows indicated\n '
'the place where the disastrous shock had occurred, but as, in the\n '
'heeling over, this aperture had been carried some five or six feet\n '
'above the water, the vessel had escaped the immediate foundering which\n '
'must otherwise have ensued; but still it wanted only the rising of a\n '
'heavy swell to submerge the ship at any time in a few minutes.\n '
'\n '
'It did not take many more strokes to bring the boat close to the\n '
'larboard bulwark, which was half out of the water, and Captain Hull\n '
'obtained a view of the whole length of the deck. It was clear from end\n '
'to end. Both masts had been snapped off within two feet of their\n '
'sockets, and had been swept away with shrouds, stays, and rigging. Not\n '
'a single spar was to be seen floating anywhere within sight of the\n '
'wreck, a circumstance from which it was to be inferred that several\n '
'days at least had elapsed since the catastrophe.\n '
'\n '
'Meantime the dog, sliding down from the taffrail, got to the centre\n '
'hatchway, which was open. Here it continued to bark, alternately\n '
'directing its eyes above deck and below.\n '
'\n '
'"Look at that dog!" said Dick; "I begin to think there must be somebody\n '
'on board."\n '
'\n '
'"If so," answered the captain, "he must have died of hunger; the water\n '
'of course has flooded the store-room."\n '
'\n '
'"No," said Dick; "that dog wouldn't look like that if there were nobody\n '
'there alive."\n '
'\n '
'[Illustration: The dog began to swim slowly and with manifest weakness\n '
'towards the boat.]\n '
'\n '
'Taking the boat as close as was prudent to the wreck, the captain and\n '
'Dick called and whistled repeatedly to the dog, which after a while let\n '
'itself slip into the sea, and began to swim slowly and with manifest\n '
'weakness towards the boat. As soon as it was lifted in, the animal,\n '
'instead of devouring the piece of bread that was offered him, made its\n '
'way to a bucket containing a few drops of fresh water, and began\n '
'eagerly to lap them up.\n '
'\n '
'"The poor wretch is dying of thirst!" said Dick.\n '
'\n '
'It soon appeared that the dog was very far from being engrossed with\n '
'its own interests. The boat was being pushed back a few yards in order\n '
'to allow the captain to ascertain the most convenient place to get\n '
'alongside the "Waldeck," when the creature seized Dick by the jacket,\n '
'and set up a howl that was almost human in its piteousness. It was\n '
'evidently in a state of alarm that the boat was not going to return to\n '
'the wreck. The dog's meaning could not be misunderstood. The boat was\n '
'accordingly brought against the larboard side of the vessel, and while\n '
'the two sailors lashed her securely to the "Waldeck's" cat-head,\n '
'Captain Hull and Dick, with the dog persistently accompanying them,\n '
'clambered, after some difficulty, to the open hatchway between the\n '
'stumps of the masts, and made their way into the hold. It was half full\n '
'of water, but perfectly destitute of cargo, its sole contents being the\n '
'ballast sand which had slipped to larboard, and now served to keep the\n '
'vessel on her side.\n '
'\n '
'One glance was sufficient to convince the captain that there was no\n '
'salvage to be effected.\n '
'\n '
'"There is nothing here; nobody here," he said.\n '
'\n '
'"So I see," said the apprentice, who had made his way to the extreme\n '
'fore-part of the hold.\n '
'\n '
'"Then we have only to go up again," remarked the captain.\n '
'\n '
'They ascended the ladder, but no sooner did they reappear upon the deck\n '
'than the dog, barking irrepressibly, began trying manifestly to drag\n '
'them towards the stern.\n '
'\n '
'Yielding to what might be called the importunities of the dog, they\n '
'followed him to the poop, and there, by the dim glimmer admitted by the\n '
'sky-light, Captain Hull made out the forms of five bodies, motionless\n '
'and apparently lifeless, stretched upon the floor.\n '
'\n '
'One after another, Dick hastily examined them all, and emphatically\n '
'declared it to be his opinion, that not one or them had actually ceased\n '
'to breathe; whereupon the captain did not lose a minute in summoning\n '
'the two sailors to his aid, and although it was far from an easy task,\n '
'he succeeded in getting the five unconscious men, who were all negroes,\n '
'conveyed safely to the boat.\n '
'\n '
'The dog followed, apparently satisfied.\n '
'\n '
'With all possible speed the boat made its way back again to the\n '
'"Pilgrim," a girt-line was lowered from the mainyard, and the\n '
'unfortunate men were raised to the deck.\n '
'\n '
'"Poor things!" said Mrs. Weldon, as she looked compassionately on the\n '
'motionless forms.\n '
'\n '
'"But they are not dead," cried Dick eagerly; "they are not dead; we\n '
'shall save them all yet!"\n '
'\n '
'"What's the matter with them?" asked Cousin Benedict, looking at them\n '
'with utter bewilderment.\n '
'\n '
'"We shall hear all about them soon, I dare say," said the captain,\n '
'smiling; "but first we will give them a few drops of rum in some water."\n '
'\n '
'Cousin Benedict smiled in return.\n '
'\n '
'"Negoro!" shouted the captain.\n '
'\n '
'At the sound of the name, the dog, who had hitherto been quite passive,\n '
'growled fiercely, showed his teeth, and exhibited every sign of rage.\n '
'\n '
'The cook did not answer.\n '
'\n '
'"Negoro!" again the captain shouted, and the dog became yet more angry.\n '
'\n '
'At this second summons Negoro slowly left his kitchen, but no sooner\n '
'had he shown his face upon the deck than the animal made a rush at him,\n '
'and would unquestionably have seized him by the throat if the man had\n '
'not knocked him back with a poker which he had brought with him in his\n '
'hand.\n '
'\n '
'The infuriated beast was secured by the sailors, and prevented from\n '
'inflicting any serious injury.\n '
'\n '
'"Do you know this dog?" asked the captain.\n '
'\n '
'"Know him? Not I! I have never set eyes on the brute in my life."\n '
'\n '
'"Strange!" muttered Dick to himself; "there is some mystery here. We\n '
'shall see."\n '

'CHAPTER IV.\n '
'\n '
'THE SURVIVORS OF THE "WALDECK."\n '
'\n '
'\n '
'In spite of the watchfulness of the French and English cruisers, there\n '
'is no doubt that the slave-trade is still extensively carried on in all\n '
'parts of equatorial Africa, and that year after year vessels loaded\n '
'with slaves leave the coasts of Angola and Mozambique to transport\n '
'their living freight to many quarters even of the civilized world.\n '
'\n '
'Of this Captain Hull was well aware, and although he was now in a\n '
'latitude which was comparatively little traversed by such slavers, he\n '
'could not help almost involuntarily conjecturing that the negroes they\n '
'had just found must be part of a slave-cargo which was on its way to\n '
'some colony of the Pacific; if this were so, he would at least have the\n '
'satisfaction of announcing to them that they had regained their freedom\n '
'from the moment that they came on board the "Pilgrim."\n '
'\n '
'Whilst these thoughts were passing through his mind, Mrs. Weldon,\n '
'assisted by Nan and the ever active Dick Sands, was doing everything in\n '
'her power to restore consciousness to the poor sufferers. The judicious\n '
'administration of fresh water and a limited quantity of food soon had\n '
'the effect of making them revive; and when they were restored to their\n '
'senses it was found that the eldest of them, a man of about sixty years\n '
'of age, who immediately regained his powers of speech, was able to\n '
'reply in good English to all the questions that were put to him. In\n '
'answer to Captain Hull's inquiry whether they were not slaves, the old\n '
'negro proudly stated that he and his companions were all free American\n '
'citizens, belonging to the state of Pennsylvania.\n '
'\n '
'[Illustration: Mrs. Weldon, assisted by Nan and the ever active Dick\n '
'Sands, was doing everything in her power to restore consciousness to\n '
'the poor sufferers.]\n '
'\n '
'"Then, let me assure you, my friend," said the captain, "you have by no\n '
'means compromised your liberty in having been brought on board the\n '
'American schooner 'Pilgrim.'"\n '
'\n '
'Not merely, as it seemed, on account of his age and experience, but\n '
'rather because of a certain superiority and greater energy of\n '
'character, this old man was tacitly recognized as the spokesman of his\n '
'party; he freely communicated all the information that Captain Hull\n '
'required to hear, and by degrees he related all the details of his\n '
'adventures.\n '
'\n '
'He said that his name was Tom, and that when he was only six years of\n '
'age he had been sold as a slave, and brought from his home in Africa to\n '
'the United States; but by the act of emancipation he had long since\n '
'recovered his freedom. His companions, who were all much younger than\n '
'himself, their ages ranging from twenty-five to thirty, were all\n '
'free-born, their parents having been emancipated before their birth, so\n '
'that no white man had ever exercised upon them the rights of ownership.\n '
'One of them was his own son; his name was Bat (an abbreviation of\n '
'Bartholomew); and there were three others, named Austin, Actæon, and\n '
'Hercules. All four of them were specimens of that stalwart race that\n '
'commands so high a price in the African market, and in spite of the\n '
'emaciation induced by their recent sufferings, their muscular,\n '
'well-knit frames betokened a strong and healthy constitution. Their\n '
'manner bore the impress of that solid education which is given in the\n '
'North American schools, and their speech had lost all trace of the\n '
'"nigger-tongue," a dialect without articles or inflexions, which since\n '
'the anti-slavery war has almost died out in the United States.\n '
'\n '
'Three years ago, old Tom stated, the five men had been engaged by an\n '
'Englishman who had large property in South Australia, to work upon his\n '
'estates near Melbourne. Here they had realized a considerable profit,\n '
'and upon the completion of their engagement they determined to return\n '
'with their savings to America. Accordingly, on the 5th of January,\n '
'after paying their passage in the ordinary way, they embarked at\n '
'Melbourne on board the "Waldeck." Everything went on well for seventeen\n '
'days, until, on the night of the 22nd, which was very dark, they were\n '
'run into by a great steamer. They were all asleep in their berths, but,\n '
'roused by the shock of the collision, which was extremely severe, they\n '
'hurriedly made their way on to the deck. The scene was terrible; both\n '
'masts were gone, and the brig, although the water had not absolutely\n '
'flooded her hold so as to make her sink, had completely heeled over on\n '
'her side. Captain and crew had entirely disappeared, some probably\n '
'having been dashed into the sea, others perhaps having saved themselves\n '
'by clinging to the rigging of the ship which had fouled them, and which\n '
'could be distinguished through the darkness rapidly receding in the\n '
'distance. For a while they were paralyzed, but they soon awoke to the\n '
'conviction that they were left alone upon a half-capsized and disabled\n '
'hull, twelve hundred miles from the nearest land. Mrs. Weldon was loud\n '
'in her expression of indignation that any captain should have the\n '
'barbarity to abandon an unfortunate vessel with which his own\n '
'carelessness had brought him into collision. It would be bad enough,\n '
'she said for a driver on a public road, when it might be presumed that\n '
'help would be forthcoming, to pass on unconcerned after causing an\n '
'accident to another vehicle; but how much more shameful to desert the\n '
'injured on the open sea, where the victims of his incompetence could\n '
'have no chance of obtaining succour! Captain Hull could only repeat\n '
'what he had said before, that incredibly atrocious as it might seem,\n '
'such inhumanity was far from rare.\n '
'\n '
'On resuming his story, Tom said that he and his companions soon found\n '
'that they had no means left for getting away from the capsized brig;\n '
'both the boats had been crushed in the collision, so that they had no\n '
'alternative except to await the appearance of a passing vessel, whilst\n '
'the wreck was drifting hopelessly along under the action of the\n '
'currents. This accounted for the fact of their being found so far south\n '
'of their proper course.\n '
'\n '
'For the next ten days the negroes had subsisted upon a few scraps of\n '
'food that they found in the stern cabin; but as the store room was\n '
'entirely under water, they were quite unable to obtain a drop of\n '
'anything to drink, and the freshwater tanks that had been lashed to the\n '
'deck had been stove in at the time of the catastrophe. Tortured with\n '
'thirst, the poor men had suffered agonies, and having on the previous\n '
'night entirely lost consciousness, they must soon have died if the\n '
'"Pilgrim's" timely arrival had not effected their rescue.\n '
'\n '
'All the outlines of Tom's narrative were fully confirmed by the other\n '
'negroes; Captain Hull could see no reason to doubt it; indeed, the\n '
'facts seemed to speak for themselves.\n '
'\n '
'One other survivor of the wreck, if he had been gifted with the power\n '
'of speech, would doubtless have corroborated the testimony. This was\n '
'the dog who seemed to have such an unaccountable dislike to Negoro.\n '
'\n '
'Dingo, as the dog was named, belonged to the fine breed of mastiffs\n '
'peculiar to New Holland. It was not, however, from Australia, but from\n '
'the coast of West Africa, near the mouth of the Congo, that the animal\n '
'had come. He had been picked up there, two years previously, by the\n '
'captain of the "Waldeck," who had found him wandering about and more\n '
'than half starved. The initials S. V. engraved upon his collar were the\n '
'only tokens that the dog had a past history of his own. After he had\n '
'been taken on board the "Waldeck," he remained quite unsociable,\n '
'apparently ever pining for some lost master, whom he had failed to find\n '
'in the desert land where he had been met with.\n '
'\n '
'Larger than the dogs of the Pyrenees, Dingo was a magnificent example\n '
'of his kind. Standing on his hind legs, with his head thrown back, he\n '
'was as tall as a man. His agility and strength would have made him a\n '
'sure match for a panther, and he would not have flinched at facing a\n '
'bear. His fine shaggy coat was a dark tawny colour, shading off\n '
'somewhat lighter round the muzzle, and his long bushy tail was as\n '
'strong as a lion's. If he were made angry, no doubt he might become a\n '
'\n '
